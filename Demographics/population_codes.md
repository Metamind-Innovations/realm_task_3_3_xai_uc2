### What do the population codes for human allele frequencies mean?

In views like [Population genetics](http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Population?r=9:22125003-22126003;v=rs1333049;vdb=variation;vf=13086978) in the variation tab, you may find three-letter codes for populations.

These come from the [HapMap project](http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and/or the [1000 Genomes project](http://www.1000genomes.org/).

The following table describes the population codes and shows which populations are grouped into super populations.
